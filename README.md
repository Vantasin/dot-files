# dot-files

A minimal, reproducible dotfiles repository for a clean terminal environment on macOS and Debian-based Linux. Uses GNU Stow for safe symlink management and pure Zsh with Antidote for explicit, fast plugin loading. Configuration is intentionally framework-free, declarative, and portable, with binaries installed via system package managers and system services managed separately.
